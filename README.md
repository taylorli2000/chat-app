# Chat App

This is a chatroom web app. You can use it to chat online with friends.
I built this app to learn more about React contexts and how to communicate with a backend. I used socket.io as the backend to send and receive messages from the client.

## Installing / Getting started


```shell
git clone https://github.com/taylorli2000/chat-app.git
cd client
npm install
npm start
```

### Initial Configuration

To run the web app, clone the repo and install the dependancies, then start the app by running the script npm start.
